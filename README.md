# Credit Card Approval Predictor

This project aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features, which will be preprocessed by splitting the data into train and test sets, handling missing values, converting non-numeric values into numeric ones, and scaling the feature values to a uniform range. The statistical correlation of features will be measured to determine the importance of each feature for predicting credit card approvals. The missing values will be imputed using the mean imputation strategy for numeric columns and the most frequent values for categorical columns. The final machine learning model will be trained and tested to predict the approval status of credit card applications.
